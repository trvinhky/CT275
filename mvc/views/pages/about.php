                        The rich text element allows you to create and format headings,
                        paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place
                        instead of having to add and format them individually. Just
                        double-click and easily create content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content.
                        For static content, just drop it into any page and begin
                        editing. For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any
                        collection and then connect a rich text element to that field in
                        the settings panel. Voila!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure
                        captions can all be styled after a class is added to the rich
                        text element using the "When inside of" nested selector system.
